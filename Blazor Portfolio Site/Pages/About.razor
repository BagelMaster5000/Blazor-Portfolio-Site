				Hello! My name's Sammy Mahmoudi, I'm a senior computer science student at the University of Texas at Dallas!
			</CardTitle>
			<CardText>
				I work on extra-curricular projects all the time, mostly in the form of programming video games. I work with a variety of people and usually fill the role of team lead and project manager. I use these projects as an excuse to learn new technologies, meet new developers in the community, and also just to have fun creating something! I mostly work with C#, and I’ve worked with both Unity and the .NET framework.
				I’m also an officer of the game developer student organization at my university, and also founded and ran the SpongeBob Club at my university for 2.5 years!
				I also do volunteering! I volunteer at a diabetes research organization and a local cat shelter.
