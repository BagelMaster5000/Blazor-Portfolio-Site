						<Paragraph>
							I’m a type 1 diabetic and I use a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) to monitor my blood sugar throughout the day and at night. My CGM plays an alarm on my phone whenever my blood sugar is critically high or low. At night, it’s especially important that I hear this alarm because an untreated low blood sugar can be dangerous. However, I have bad hearing! I often sleep through this alarm at night when it goes off.
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							So, I decided to set up a smart lamp to shine a light at me at night in place of the alert tone to hopefully wake me up more reliably.

						To start, I researched if any others online had done similar projects. I was able to find a person who had done something similar, and luckily <Link Target="Target.Blank" To="https://libbyrome.com/health/type-1-diabetes/flashing-my-lights-when-my-blood-sugar-is-too-high-or-too-low/">they published a tutorial article</Link>. It wasn’t a particularly detailed tutorial, but it helped a lot! It pointed me in the right direction regarding what technologies to use and proved to me that the project was feasible.
					</Paragraph>
					<h6>I decided to use the following tech stack recommended by the article:</h6>
					<ListGroup>
						<ListGroupItem>
							• The web app Nightscout to gather information from my CGM (Dexcom G6) via the Dexcom API.
						</ListGroupItem>
						<ListGroupItem>
							• Heroku to host the web app.
						</ListGroupItem>
						<ListGroupItem>
							• MongoDB to remotely store blood sugar readings.
						</ListGroupItem>
						<ListGroupItem>
							• IFTTT to listen for Nightscout low+high blood sugar events and then invoke a smart light to turn on.
						</ListGroupItem>
					</ListGroup>

						I installed Raspberry Pi OS onto my Raspberry Pi 3 and set up the Nightscout web app on it. I edited the Pi’s startup script so that it opened the web app in as soon as the device turned on.

				@*Problem: I sometimes forget to turn on or off my Pi*@
				<Heading Size="HeadingSize.Is3" Padding="Padding.Is2" TextAlignment="TextAlignment.Center">Problem #1: I sometimes forgot to turn my Pi on or off</Heading>
				<Row Margin="Margin.Is2">
					<Paragraph>
						The smart light only worked if the web app was actively running; so, every night I needed to remember to turn the Pi on. I also needed to remember to turn the Pi off in the morning so the light wouldn't turn on while I was out of the house.
					</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>
						After several months, I realized that I had trouble making the on-and-off switching a routine and I would often forget about it. So, my solution was to leave the Pi running continuously but only allow it to turn on my smart light within set hours (11pm – 7am). This required an upgrade to my IFTTT subscription, but the peace of mind was worth the extra cost.

					<Paragraph>
						After a few months, I noticed that the smart lamp—regardless of light strength—was small enough that I could ignore it sometimes by turning over in my bed. So, I figured it would be better to instead turn my room’s lights on.

					<Paragraph>
						I bought and am currently using LIFX smart bulbs and have never once slept through the lights in my room turning off!
